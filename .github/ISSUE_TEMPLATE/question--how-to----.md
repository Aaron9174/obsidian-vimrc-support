**Before posting, please make sure your question is within the scope of this plugin.**

This plugin is about *persisting changes* to the Vim support built into Obsidian, plus some bonus features.
If you want to ask about some generic Vim features, it might be more suitable for the [CodeMirror Vim repo](https://github.com/replit/codemirror-vim) or the [Obsidian forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/c/get-help/19).
